   Project : Expense Tracker
   
   Features:
   
      1) Input Validation: Added validation for the amount to ensure it's a positive number and for the date format.
      
      2) Dynamic Memory Allocation: The program uses dynamic memory for expenses, which will allow handling a variable number of records.
      
      3) File Persistence: Expenses are saved to a file (expenses.txt) and loaded on program start, ensuring data is persistent.
      
      4) Date Validation: A helper function checks if the date is in DD-MM-YYYY format.
      
      5) Modularity: The code is divided into smaller functions, each with a clear responsibility.
      
      6) Search Functionality: Allow the user to search for expenses by category, date, or amount range.
      
      7) Edit or Delete Expenses: Enable the user to modify or delete a specific expense. This feature adds flexibility in managing expenses
