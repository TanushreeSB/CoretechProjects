## I) C: Expense Tracker

### Features:
1. **Input Validation**: Ensures only valid input is accepted, such as positive expense amounts and valid date formats.
2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Uses dynamic memory for handling an adjustable number of expenses.
3. **File Persistence**: Saves expenses to `expenses.txt`, allowing data to persist between sessions.
4. **Date Validation**: Verifies that the entered date follows the DD-MM-YYYY format.
5. **Modular Design**: Code is organized into smaller functions with clear responsibilities, improving readability and maintainability.
6. **Search Functionality**: Users can search expenses by category, date, or amount range.
7. **Expense Editing and Deletion**: Enables modification or deletion of specific expenses, offering flexibility in managing data.

## III) Java: Weather Forecast

### Features:
1. **Real-Time Weather Information**: Provides users with up-to-date weather data.
2. **Secure Data Retrieval**: Utilizes Java's `HttpURLConnection` to securely fetch weather information from external APIs.
3. **OpenWeatherMap API Integration**: Integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide comprehensive weather details.

## V) OS: Bank Simulation System

### Features:
1. **Bank Account Operations**: Users can create accounts, deposit funds, withdraw money, transfer funds, and check balances.
2. **Transaction Logging**: Logs every transaction with timestamps to provide a detailed history.
3. **Interest Application**: Simulates interest calculation on account balances.
4. **Account Deletion**: Users can delete accounts by entering the account number.
5. **Multi-Account Management**: Supports managing multiple accounts within the system.
6. **Customer Interaction**: A text-based menu allows customers to perform various banking operations.
7. **Real-Time Transaction History**: Users can view transaction logs and track their financial activity.
8. **Dynamic Account Creation**: Allows for creating new accounts dynamically during runtime.
9. **Balance Check**: Users can check the current balance of their accounts.
10. **Input Validation**: Ensures the user provides valid input for different banking operations.

### OS Principles Used:
1. **Concurrency**: Simulates concurrent access where multiple users can perform actions simultaneously.
2. **Synchronization**: Ensures safe access to shared resources, such as bank accounts, using locking mechanisms (mutex).
3. **Atomicity**: Ensures that transactions (deposit, withdrawal, transfer) either complete fully or fail, preserving system consistency.
4. **Resource Management**: Bank accounts are managed efficiently, ensuring no resource conflicts.
5. **Memory Management**: Dynamically allocates memory for bank accounts during runtime.
6. **Input/Output Operations**: Handles user inputs for transactions and outputs transaction logs and balances.
7. **Error Handling**: Manages errors like insufficient funds or invalid inputs.
8. **Time Management**: Tracks transaction timestamps, similar to scheduling in OS processes.
9. **State Management**: Tracks account state (balance, transaction history), similar to process state tracking in OS.
10. **User Interaction**: Prompts users for input and feedback, similar to interactive OS environments.
